## Double Consonants

The last few consonants we need to learn to know all consonants of Hangul are the double consonants.

The following double consonants exist in Korean: ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ

So these might already seem familiar. They look like their regular forms but doubled, written twice but still within the same space.
- ㄱ: ㄲ
- ㄷ: ㄸ
- ㅂ: ㅃ
- ㅅ: ㅆ
- ㅈ: ㅉ

Double consonants are made with the same sound as regular consonants but by slightly tensing your mouth before pronouncing them. Hence they are also often called the tense consonants.

- ㄲ sounds more like a "g", compared to "ㄱ" which is more of a mix of between "k/g".
- ㄸ sounds more like a "d", compared to "ㄷ" which is more of a mix of between "d/t".
- ㅃ sounds more like a "b", compared to "ㅂ" which is more of a mix of between "b/p".
- ㅆ sounds more like a sharp "s/z" sound, compared to "ㅅ" which is more like a regular "s".
- ㅉ is harder to describe in romanized sounds. The official romanization for ㅈ is "j" and for ㅉ it is "jj". Like described earlier, for ㅉ pronounce ㅈ but with more force at the beginning of the pronunciation.

For a Korean learner these letters might be hard to differentiate in the beginning:
- ㄱ, ㄲ, ㅋ
- ㄷ, ㄸ, ㅌ
- ㅂ, ㅃ, ㅍ
- ㅅ, ㅆ
- ㅈ, ㅉ, ㅊ

(*Audio example of how these sound will be added in the future!*)

Try practising these with actual words in which they come up, that should feel easier and more natural than listening to these sounds in isolation. I recommend studying with an Anki deck that has audio included, like [this first 500 words one](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1551455917). This [pronunciation example](https://youtu.be/J36m4cSl2W4?t=417) by BillyGo also might be helpful to you.

Congratulations 🎉 Now you know all consonants of Hangul: ㄱ, ㄲ,ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄸ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅃ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅇ, ㅈ, ㅉ, ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅎ
