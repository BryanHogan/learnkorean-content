There are only a few vowels remaining to know all characters of the Korean alphabet.

## Diphthongs Vowels

Diphthongs are two vowels in one. They are just a combination of the vowels we already know.

You should remember these simpler vowels from our [earlier lesson](/chapter/korean-alphabet-hangul):
- ㅏ = a
- ㅓ = eo
- ㅗ = o
- ㅜ = u

By adding an extra line we can add a "y" sound like this:
- ㅑ = ya
- ㅕ = yeo
- ㅛ = yo
- ㅠ = yu

Combined with the consonant "ㄱ" they sound like this: 갸("gya"), 겨("gyeo"), 교("gyo"), 규("gyu").  
Combined with the consonant "ㄷ" they sound like this: 댜("dya"), 뎌("dyeo"), 됴("dyo"), 듀("dyu").

## The common vowels "ㅐ" and "ㅔ"
- ㅐ = ae (sounds like "eh")
- ㅔ = e (sounds like "eh")

Both 애 and 에 sound like "eh".  
In modern Korean they actually have the same sound. Officially and historically there is/was a difference but nowadays they sound the same. (*By the way, they are not diphthongs*)

By adding an extra line we can add a "y" sound like this:
- ㅒ = yae (sounds like "yeh")
- ㅖ = ye (sounds like "yeh")

With these vowels you can build words like these:
- 네 (ne): Yes
- 새 (sae): Bird, New
- 예약 (yeyak): Reservation

## The more complex diphthongs

There are only a few vowels remaining until you know **all** characters in Hangul.  
These vowels are all a combination of vowels we already know:
- ㅘ: ㅗ + ㅏ = "woa"
- ㅙ: ㅗ + ㅐ = "weh"
- ㅚ: ㅗ + ㅣ = "weh"
- ㅝ: ㅜ + ㅓ = "wo"
- ㅞ: ㅜ + ㅔ = "weh" (very uncommon)
- ㅟ: ㅜ + ㅣ = "wi"
- ㅢ: ㅡ + ㅣ = "ui"*

Aside from 외 and 의 they all sound mostly like you would expect from combining them.  
의 has some special pronunciation rules I will go into in a later chapter.  
외 is pronounced just like 왜 and 웨, yes they are all pronounced the same.

So these are all vowels in Hangul: ㅏ, ㅐ, ㅑ, ㅒ, ㅓ, ㅔ, ㅕ, ㅖ, ㅗ, ㅘ, ㅙ, ㅚ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅝ, ㅞ, ㅟ, ㅠ, ㅡ, ㅢ, ㅣ
