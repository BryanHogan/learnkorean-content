You have finished unit 0! 🥳

Before you start with [unit 1](/chapter/unit-1-introduction) I recommend some further content for practising and exploring your recent learnings down below.

##  Further resources

Further resources that will be helpful to you now:
- Practice the letters of Hangul with this pre-made Anki deck: [Anki deck containing flashcards for all characters of Hangul](/files/ToLearnKoreanHangul.apkg) (or the <a href="/files/ToLearnKoreanHangul.txt" download>.txt file</a>).
- There are some sound change rules which are really helpful to know. I would suggest watching [this video by BillyGo](https://youtu.be/s5aobqyEaMQ?t=3690) on the Korean sound change rules. I wouldn't suggest adding these into a flashcard deck yet as you will come across these naturally on your learning journey, so just hearing about them once for now should be enough.
- [How to pronunce 의](https://youtu.be/2bLlrXDZ478) by BillyGo.
- Get this Anki deck: [TTMIK's First 500 Korean Words by Retro](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1551455917). It includes mostly relevant Korean words with pictures and audio for their pronunciation.

I recommend learning with the two Anki decks. See [how to use Anki here](/blog/how-to-anki).
