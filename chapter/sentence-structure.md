In Korean the structure of the sentence is different from English. A sentence in Korean is usually built the following way:  
**Subject Object Verb**

Sentences in English follow this structure: **Subject Verb Object**

So instead of saying "I eat bread." You would say "I bread eat." if you were to use the Korean sentence order. This sentence in Korean would be "저는 빵 먹어요.".
